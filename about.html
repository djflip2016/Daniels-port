					<p style="text-indent: 2em;">I am a self taught web developer out of Orlando, Florida. I am also a former United States Army service member. After i got out of the Army i went down many different paths. Not all were pleasant but i found a way most of the time. After overcoming alot of life hurstles and adjusting back to the civilian way of life i found i had a decision to make. Which was finding a new career that i would do for the rest of my life.
					</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Coding was not something i ever thought i would be doing. But after alot of road blocks i found myself looking into a coding bootcamp, which is when i realized i could teach this stuff to myself without having to ever go to a bootcamp or college. I then looked into online sources to learn from i started out at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" class="hotlink">Code Academy</a>. Then realized i wanted to be able to feel like i was in a real classroom, but from the comfort of my parents kitchen table. Yes my parents thats where i was living at the time of making this site. Anyways i decided to look into 
					<a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" class="hotlink">Teamtreehouse</a>. That was when i found how much i loved coding and i picked it up very quickly.
					</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Within 1 week i was making responzive websites form HTML and CSS. Once i made a desktop site i met <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathansampson" class="hotlink">Jonathan Sampson</a> one of the devs for the Brave browser. He taught me alot and really kept me motivated to keep moving forward. Within months of constant studying and motivation i was making the incredible websites you see on my project page. If you enjoyed the sites you saw and the testimonials of the people i have made sites for and want to be one of them. Contact me anytime, my contact information is located on the contact page. Thank you for vising the page. I look forward to hearing from you.
